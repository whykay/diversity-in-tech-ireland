# Diversity in Tech in Ireland
I've been maintaining a list of Diversity in Tech groups around the island of Ireland since 2017, and I think it's about the right time to get more of the community involved (and a chance for me to try a new framework out).

This means I can crowdsource any updates to the list of diversity in tech groups in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Folks can send in PRs, to do that, they will need to update the "diversityGroups.yaml" in src/_data. If you don't want to do that, you can create an issue or drop me an email at contact@codinggrace.com

# Irish hosted events
Also on my TODO list is write something to pull Irish hosted events

* where I can curate them
* remove duplicates
* remove non-techie events
* and this one is more custom for me, output HTML code that I can paste into my Mailchimp for my monthyly newsletters. Hand-curation takes so much time, this may help solve that problem.

### Some caveats
There's lots of Irish meetup groups sharing non-Irish events, and these are generating more work when it comes to curation for my monthly newsletters and live blogs on Irish events. There are some exceptions:

* some events may benefit the community even though they are not Irish hosted
* some events may have Irish-based speakers
* some events maybe co-hosted by someone based in Ireland
* events maybe recommended by community

This is still an idea in the making, things may change, but I hope information here can benefit others in the community and also gain some community contributers.
